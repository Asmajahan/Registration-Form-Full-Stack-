# Description:

This code represents a simple user registration and management system built using React, Axios, and a mock API. The application consists of two main components: RegistrationForm and AxiosPost, and is integrated into an overall React application.
## RegistrationForm Component:

- This component serves as the user interface for user registration.
- Utilizes React's `useState` hook to manage form data, including fields for username, email, and password.
- Users can input their registration details, and the component tracks these changes using the `handleInputChange` function.
- The form data is then passed as a prop to the `AxiosPost` component for further processing.

## AxiosPost Component:

- The `AxiosPost` component handles HTTP requests and simulates various user management actions.
- It receives the form data from the `RegistrationForm` component as a prop.
- Three main actions are simulated: registration, profile update, and account deletion. Each action is triggered by clicking a respective button.
- Axios is employed to make mock POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to predefined API endpoints.
- Success or failure messages are displayed to the user based on the outcomes of these requests.

## App Component:

- The `App` component serves as the entry point of the React application.
- It incorporates the `RegistrationForm` component within the app's structure.

Overall, this code provides the foundation for a straightforward user registration and management system. Users can register, update their profiles, and delete their accounts. The application illustrates how to handle form input, perform HTTP requests using Axios, and provide user feedback for these actions. It can serve as a starting point for developing more advanced user authentication and management features within a React application.
